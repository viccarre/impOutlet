# impOutlet/Wi-Fi Outlet
Project for the First Build &amp; Upverter Challenge

This project is a Internet controlled Outlet. It uses a Electric Imp Developer Board and is controlled via iPhone. It means, you can control your outlet with your iPhone/iOS device.

It is very easy to use, the upverter design contains the board that contains 3 switches, every switch is controlled independently. The design does not contains the outlets because you can select any model of outlet and just connect.

In the iOS app you just need to write the agent URL from your Electric Imp. The code for the imp and the iOS code are open source.
